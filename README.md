IMPROVEMENTS:
1.  average cart value of approx. 750 over week/month is to be maintained
2.  Split up orders into line-items as one tailor does not do every line-item well
3.  use table component to present orders info
4.  have feature for rejecting a particular sku for quality issues. this should show on tailor dashboard as a negative commission.
